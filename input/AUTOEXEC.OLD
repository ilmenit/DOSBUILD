ECHO OFF

REM NOTE: If you remove this file from your boot disks, 
REM   the FreeDOS boot will automaticall prompt user for date/time
REM   That issue can be fixed by adding the "/D" flag in CONFIG.SYS
REM   to the COMMAND.COM line , but /D will also make FreeDOS skip
REM   execution of AUTOEXEC.BAT.
